# discrete-tools
Stupid math and logic experiments. Derive the complete truth table of all 16 first order logic truth functions using only simple relations between {0 to 3} and {0 to 15}. Use the complete truth table to also derive all valid rules of inference (under first order logic), including those not commonly used.

Propositions are codified as objects which have both a string value and truth value. These objects can be composed with the first-order logic module.

I'd like to build this project out further into the broader discrete math domain whenever I find the time to do so. Maybe it'll be something that's not stupid and more like a set of useful tools to someone at least. Could be useful for general deductive reasoning, mathematical, philosophical, or otherwise. This works partly because Boolean algebra and propositional calculus are isomorphic.
